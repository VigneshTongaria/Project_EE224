we have to tolerate ViRu BeSt prof for sometime, which can't be avoided but using VHDL codes is really intresting :) Arithmetic Logical Unit (ALU) for computing for two inputs X and Y (16 bits) and a control input S1S0;

Fast adder.
Subtraction.
XOR operation.
NAND operation output must be a output(16 bits) and carry(for addition and subtraction) and a Z output which is 1 when output is 0.
