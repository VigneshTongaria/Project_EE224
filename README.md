We have to tolerate ViRu BeSt prof for sometime, which can't be avoided but using VHDL  is really intresting :) Arithmetic Logical Unit (ALU) for computing for two inputs X and Y (16 bits) and two control inputs S1 and S0;

1. Fast adder( not ripple carry adder).
2. Subtraction.
3. XOR operation.
4. NAND operation 

Output must be a output(16 bits) and carry(for addition and subtraction) and a Z output which is 1 when output is 0.
    
   test bench is uploaded, modify input values and control inputs to see different results!!.
   
   Also i have uploaded seperate file ALU which uses port map of carry and generation(carry and gen) unlike ALU_1 which directly does it.
